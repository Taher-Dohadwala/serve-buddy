## Goal


Deploy a real time voice assistant tennis serve coach using edge technology. The AI coach will assess your serve and verbally give feedback to identify incorrect biomechanics.


## Background

Tennis is a sport that requires lots of practice with each type of stroke. However, during most group practices, emphasis is placed on practicing forehand, backhand, and volleys and not serves. If you are looking to practice serves, good news is that you can go out alone and practice. However, to most amateur players, the indication for if you are serving well is whether or not the ball went in and if it looked fast. The reality is that a serve is very technical and without being able to look at yourself you might not be able to catch all the mistakes.

## Purpose

For players wanting to improve their serve, this will allow them to serve and get instant feedback to correct mistakes, without the need of paid coaching.
